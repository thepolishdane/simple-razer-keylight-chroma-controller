Hello! 

I have created this web-app, python thingy, with the use of Gemini AI. 
Currently it only has the light control, not the chroma panel control, this will be added soon.

You need to use razer software to pair the lights with your wifi and then find which IP your lights have.
Once you know this you can delete any razer software again and use this app instead. 

You can control your lights with streamdeck using this app.
Simply click the copy link on the scenes you create.
Use any web functionality on the streamdeck (im presonally using BarRaiders API Ninja plugin)
And paste the URL into those buttons. 

Hope this helps others as it has helped me.
