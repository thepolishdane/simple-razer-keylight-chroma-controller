Hello! 

I have created this web-app, python thingy, with the use of Gemini AI. 
Currently it only has the light control, not the chroma panel control, this will be added soon.

You need to use razer software to pair the lights with your wifi and then find which IP your lights have.
Once you know this you can delete any razer software again and use this app instead. 

You simply double click the .pyw file. This starts a python process and opens a HTML browser window. 
Book mark this window to access the control panel. 
Add the .pyw file to your start up folder if you want it to start with windows. 

You can control your lights with streamdeck using this app.
Simply click the copy link on the scenes you create.
Use any web functionality on the streamdeck (im presonally using BarRaiders API Ninja plugin)
And paste the URL into those buttons. 

Hope this helps others as it has helped me.
